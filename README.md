# Agri Risk Guard

Decentralized Agricultural Futures and Options MarketPlace on ICP.

Allowing farmers to hedge their risk and investors to invest in agriculture.

## Inspiration 💡

Agriculture is a cornerstone of the African economy, contributing to a significant portion of the continent's GDP and employment. However, the sector is plagued by low productivity, high volatility, and low income, largely due to the farmers' vulnerability to weather, pests, and market fluctuations. Government initiatives such as MSP, crop insurance, and subsidies have not been as effective as hoped, leaving farmers in a precarious financial state. The recent farmer protests in India serve as a stark reminder of the farmers' plight.

The underlying issue is the absence of access to finance and technology, which prevents farmers from adopting modern farming practices and equipment, as well as hedging their risk through futures and options. 
Additionally, farmers face the challenge of unreliable buyers and losses due to buyer defaulting. This unpredictability in the market and the risk of defaulting buyers lead to significant financial losses for farmers, who often have to sell their produce at lower prices or face the loss of their entire harvest.

## What it does 🚀

Agri Risk Guard is a decentralized agricultural futures and options marketplace on the Internet Computer. It allows farmers to hedge their risk and investors to invest in agriculture. The farmers can hedge their risk by selling futures and options on their crops. The investors can invest in agriculture by buying futures and options on the crops. The farmers and investors can trade futures and options on the platform. The platform uses smart contracts to ensure trust and transparency. The smart contracts are executed on the Internet Computer, which is a decentralized and secure platform. The smart contracts are used to prove the creditworthiness of the farmers and the ownership of the land. The smart contracts are also used to execute the futures and options contracts. The platform uses the Internet Computer's native token, ICP, as the medium of exchange. The ICP token is used to pay for the futures and options contracts. The ICP token is also used to pay for the execution of the smart contracts.

## How we built it 🛠️

We built Agri Risk Guard using Rust and Next JS. We used Rust to write the smart contracts for the futures and options marketplace. We used Next JS to build the frontend for the platform. We used the Internet Computer's SDK to deploy the smart contracts and the frontend on the Internet Computer. We used the Internet Computer's native token, ICP, as the medium of exchange. The ICP token is used to pay for the futures and options contracts. The ICP token is also used to pay for the execution of the smart contracts.

## Challenges we ran into 🤯

The main challenge we ran into was the lack of documentation and examples for the Internet Computer. The Internet Computer is a new platform and there are not many resources available for it. We had to spend a lot of time reading the source code and experimenting with the platform. We also had to spend a lot of time debugging the smart contracts and the frontend. The lack of documentation and examples made it difficult to understand the platform and build the platform.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆

We are proud of building a decentralized agricultural futures and options marketplace on the Internet Computer. We are proud of using smart contracts to ensure trust and transparency in the agriculture sector. We are proud of using the Internet Computer's native token, ICP, as the medium of exchange. We are proud of building a platform that can help farmers hedge their risk and investors invest in agriculture.

## What we learned 📚

We learned a lot about the Internet Computer and smart contracts. We learned how to write smart contracts in Rust and deploy them on the Internet Computer. We learned how to build a frontend for the Internet Computer using Next JS. We learned how to use the Internet Computer's native token, ICP, as the medium of exchange.

## What's next for Agri Risk Guard 🚀

Using futures as collateral for loans and credit scoring for farmers using smart contracts.
Also adding a DAO to manage the creation of new futures and options contracts.
